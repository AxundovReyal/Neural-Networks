## How Neural Networks Work
Neural Networks consist of interconnected layers of neurons. Each neuron receives input, applies weights, passes it through an activation function, and forwards it to the next layer. Training is performed using backpropagation to adjust weights and minimize errors.

## Key Components
1. **Input Layer**: Accepts input features.
2. **Hidden Layers**: Perform computations and feature extraction.
3. **Output Layer**: Provides the final prediction or classification.
4. **Weights & Biases**: Parameters learned during training.
5. **Activation Functions**: Determine neuron output, e.g., ReLU, Sigmoid, Softmax.
6. **Loss Function**: Measures the error between predictions and actual values.
7. **Optimizer**: Adjusts weights to minimize the loss function.

## Types of Neural Networks
- **Feedforward Neural Networks (FNNs)**: Basic structure with forward information flow.
- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Specialized for image processing.
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: Designed for sequential data like time series and text.
- **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**: Used for generating new data samples.
- **Transformer Networks**: Used in NLP applications like ChatGPT.

## Applications
Neural Networks are used in:
- Image and speech recognition
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Algorithmic trading and stock prediction
- Healthcare diagnostics
- Autonomous driving

## Installation & Setup
To use neural networks, install the necessary libraries:
```bash
pip install tensorflow keras torch numpy matplotlib
```

## Example Implementation
Here’s a simple neural network using TensorFlow/Keras:
```python
import tensorflow as tf
from tensorflow import keras
import numpy as np

# Create a simple sequential model
model = keras.Sequential([
    keras.layers.Dense(64, activation='relu', input_shape=(10,)),
    keras.layers.Dense(32, activation='relu'),
    keras.layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid')
])

# Compile the model
model.compile(optimizer='adam', loss='binary_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])

# Generate dummy data
X_train = np.random.rand(100, 10)
y_train = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)

# Train the model
model.fit(X_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=10)
```
